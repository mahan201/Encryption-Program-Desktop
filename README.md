# Encryption-Program-Desktop
Windows Encryption program developed as part of my EPQ qualification. 


For my Extended Project Qualification (EPQ), I decided to explore security and encryption and build a program that can encrypt and decrypt
text files. The first part of my research was spent researching which programming languages would benefit me the most and any frameworks 
that were useful to my program. The second part of my research was exploring encryption methods and which method I could use to implement 
into my program.

This is the final version.
