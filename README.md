# Encryption-Program-Desktop
Windows Encryption program developed as part of my EPQ qualification. 


For my Extended Project Qualification (EPQ), I decided to explore security and encryption and build a program that can encrypt and decrypt
text files. The first part of my research was spent researching which programming languages would benefit me the most and any frameworks 
that were useful to my program. The second part of my research was exploring encryption methods and which method I could use to implement 
into my program.

_This program was developed using the **QT** framework built using C++._

# VERSION 2

For my second version, I decided to implement decryption of text using Caesar Cipher. The program looked very similar to the first version
except it being split into two sections where the user can both encrypt and decrypt text at real-time instantaneously.

**THIS VERSION DOES NOT HAVE THE SOURCE CODE AVAILABLE AS I WAS NOT USING GITHUB AT THE TIME OF DEVELOPMENT**
