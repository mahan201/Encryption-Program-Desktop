# Encryption-Program-Desktop
Windows Encryption program developed as part of my EPQ qualification. 


For my Extended Project Qualification (EPQ), I decided to explore security and encryption and build a program that can encrypt and decrypt
text files. The first part of my research was spent researching which programming languages would benefit me the most and any frameworks 
that were useful to my program. The second part of my research was exploring encryption methods and which method I could use to implement 
into my program.

_This program was developed using the **QT** framework built using C++._

**This is the final version as of now**

# VERSION 4

At this point into the project I was happy with the design and I wanted to implement the final encryption algorithms and the final changes 
that were needed to be made. I decided to change the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm from using a number key to using my implementation 
of word key. It is very similar to the previous version except for some back-end tweaks. I have implemented my implementation of the Caesar 
Cipher key in form of a word which can be randomly generated by clicking the “Random Key” button or if it is left blank when the user types 
in their message, the program will automatically generate a random key, only if the field is empty. For decryption, the user is not allowed 
to type in their cypher text until they have entered a key. An error message shows if the user tries to enter their cypher text before 
entering the key. They key itself is generated using randomising algorithms and gives back an ASCII value which can be corresponded to a 
character. This way the key is a word and not just a single number, therefore, the algorithm is more secure. I also implemented a method of 
hiding the key in the cypher text of the encrypted file. The placement of the key is known by the algorithm so it is easy for the program to
find the key.
