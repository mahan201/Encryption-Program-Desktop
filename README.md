# Encryption-Program-Desktop
Windows Encryption program developed as part of my EPQ qualification. 


For my Extended Project Qualification (EPQ), I decided to explore security and encryption and build a program that can encrypt and decrypt
text files. The first part of my research was spent researching which programming languages would benefit me the most and any frameworks 
that were useful to my program. The second part of my research was exploring encryption methods and which method I could use to implement 
into my program.

_This program was developed using the **QT** framework built using C++._

# VERSION 1

This is the first version of my program. I wanted to have a working program that could encrypt text in real time using Caesar Cipher. For 
this version I designed a basic Graphical User Interface that would allow the user to enter their text at the bottom box, choose a desired 
key and then have that plain text encrypted and displayed on the area above the box. This version I only used Caesar Cipher and the Caesar 
Cipher key was not a word but only a number. It was only a prototype to see a working program that encrypts data and can handle any 
character on the keyboard.

**THIS VERSION DOES NOT HAVE THE SOURCE CODE AVAILABLE AS I WAS NOT USING GITHUB AT THE TIME OF DEVELOPMENT**
